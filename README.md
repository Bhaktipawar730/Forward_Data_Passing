# ForwardDataPassing

**ForwardDataPassing** is a simple iOS application built using Swift and UIKit. This project demonstrates how to implement data passing from one view controller to another.  

## Features  
- **Data Passing:** Pass data seamlessly from one view controller to another using direct property assignment.  
- **Text Input Fields:** Collect user input with text fields for name and address.  
- **Navigation Controller:** Navigate between screens with smooth transitions using `UINavigationController`.  
- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Display passed data dynamically on the second view controller's labels.  

## How It Works  
- **Input Handling:** The first view controller collects user input (name and address) via text fields.  
- **Data Passing:** On the **Continue** button, the data is passed to the second view controller through property variables (`name` and `address`).  
- **UI Update:** The second view controller displays the passed data in labels.
